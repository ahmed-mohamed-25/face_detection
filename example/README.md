# Example app

This folder contains a minimal example app that demonstrates how to use the
`google_mlkit_face_detection` plugin to detect faces in a picked image.

Run the example from this folder:

```bash
# from package root
cd example
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

The example uses `image_picker` to choose an image from the gallery and
displays the detected faces' bounding boxes information in the UI.
